 Music Player Application This project is an Android-based Music Player application designed to fetch and display a list of songs
from the device’s storage. The application allows users to view and select songs from their internal storage,
particularly focusing on .mp3 files. Once a song is selected, the app navigates to a new activity (likely a
”PlaySong” activity) to play the selected song.
